Repository for the course Advanced Programming in R at LinkÃ¶ping
University. Assignment 5.

We are going to use the Kolada API using JSON, the API has a
documentation and follows the REST principle. The documentation can be
found here.

A Tutorial how to consume a REST-API in R can be found here.

The packages needed are httr for the HTTP communication and jsonlite for
mapping JSON data to data.frames.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
